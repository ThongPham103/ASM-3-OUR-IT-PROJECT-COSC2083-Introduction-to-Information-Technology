        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">Hello there, academics. My name is Phuc, but I'm known as "Zero" by my friends and family. I am a freshman RMIT student. As a current RMIT student, I was given a student ID (s4015692) to help me identify myself at the institution. I'm Vietnamese, and I'm proud of being Vietnamese. Learning Spanish is one of my hobbies, and I am also a major admirer of the Barcelona football team. I have no prior experience in the information technology industry, but I intend to undertake some basic tasks in order to obtain more knowledge and useful information, as well as to refine my abilities, in order to satisfy the standards for becoming a cybersecurity specialist. Some areas of the IT industry pique my interest. Examples include cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and robotics. I'm not sure what is ideal for me because I'm not skilled at any specific skills or methods, and I'm hoping to find out which ones fit me soon so that I may chart a clear path for my career.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">I am Nghiem Minh Anh; my student ID number is s3928998. My current academic year at RMIT University is my second year of the Bachelor of Tourism and Hospitality Management program. I was born and raised as a Saigonese, graduated from the same elementary school, Asian International High School, in 2021. Spending time with my family and friends while participating in both indoor and outdoor activities is what I enjoy doing the most when I have free time because I am constantly busy with school and part-time employment throughout the week. I can't say that I was particularly interested in IT back then because my favorite classes in high school were English and literature. In contrast, when I was in my tenth grade, I enrolled in an informatics skill class and got immediately interested. I personally find chatterbots to be really intriguing, especially on Facebook where automated messaging for businesses is available. Chatbots are not only useful for providing customer care, but they can also save a lot of information from client interactions and use it to improve social media marketing. I'm convinced that chatbots will be important to my soon-to-be-running Facebook and Instagram internet business.</p>

I studied through the English course and then officially entered the university program because I want to improve my skills and make more friends in this university environment. I have made many plans with different development directions, especially after finishing this first semester. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City, but my hometown of Ben Tre is the place associated with many of my memories and joys the most. I am a rather quiet person when I have not met new friends, but when I am close, I am carefree and always happy to do my best. Moreover, I am very passionate about football and watching movies because after a tiring day, playing football or watching movies will help me feel much more comfortable. I hope to become proficient in the skills that the IT industry offers. My dream for the future is perhaps to use the skills I have learned to help my career, improve lives, and contribute to the future.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:large; color: rgb(172, 46, 124);">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <H2 style="font-size:larger;color: rgb(170, 12, 83);">1.Overview</H2>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">a.Topic</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text"> Our team project is about a health application for smartphones and other smart devices. We aim to provide people with solutions to healthcare problems. That is why our application is named 'HEALTH CARE.' Our application can assist individuals dealing with nutrition, sleep disorder, and fitness issues in improving their overall health. To achieve this, we gather data from experts and doctors worldwide and combine it with AI and chatbots to provide treatment progress updates to patients; not only that, but we also connect with physical hospitals and clinics to let the users talk face-to-face with doctors or experts to make the treatment more accurate and specify to each user. Additionally, we have designed a daily checklist to ensure that they don't miss any steps in their treatment progress and can attain their desired results and also to track the patient's health condition day by day. Once this project is done with the first step, we will move on to the next step which is to provide treatment for many more different health issues. We want our application to become useful and to be what people think of first when they have health problems.<p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">b.Motivation</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">With the advancement of civilization nowadays. We can profit the most from that progress, but we must also endure the consequences, which include diabetes, obesity, malnutrition, sleeping disorders, being overweight, etc. As a result, our initiative is to target those who are too busy or do not know how to take care of themselves. Many people around us suffer from the health concerns described, and the situation may worsen if nothing is done. Therefore, we hope that our app may assist society in taking excellent care of themselves with the treatment, and also raise awareness about health and let them know that prevention is better than cure. For that reason, this topic attracted our team and it is also important to society as this is the solution for vast numbers of people in the society.<br>
        For the beginning of this application, we only used 2 programming languages to build this application which are: Python and Java. Due to the advantages of each language, we combine them together to bring out the most efficient features. For instance, Python is well known for its power, security, and ability to develop cross-platform applications, making it an ideal choice for a healthcare app and for JAVA is the user interface, software management, and maintenance and also due to its ease of use, flexible syntax, and user-friendly nature. But our team tends to have more improvement for this platform to have a better service.</p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">c.Lanscape</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">We have compared the project with some other applications currently existing in Vietnam. The “Apple Health” also published by Apple, has some similarities to our app, such as health tracking and giving information about health but the difference is that “Apple Health” can only be used on IOS while “Health Care” can be used on both IOS and Android. Compare with other apps which are called “nCoV” and “Vietnam Health Declaration” which are both published by the Vietnam government, can be used on both IOS and Android which is the as our; but “nCoV” only have information about Covid-19 and “Vietnam Health Declaration” is only used for foreigners to declare their health situation when entry Vietnam. So we can say that “Health Care” has a wider variable range of users and more functions than other health applications. That is why our project is partly more competitive.</p>
    <H2 style="font-size:larger;color: rgb(170, 12, 83);">2.Detail Description</H2>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">a.Aim</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">We aim to build a project in the health field to provide solutions, and treatments to health problems with the new and correct information to help people improve their health conditions as well as have a higher understanding of the importance of health.<br>
        We have several goals with this app, it is about health but that is not the only one. First, as mentioned before we built this app to take care of nutrition, sleep disorder, and also fitness, further than this is other issues and diseases such as chiropractic, ocular disease, oral disease, etc.<br>
        Our second goal is to do first-aid training for some of the situations like choking or hemostasis, etc. We have to keep this simple for everyone to follow and because this is first-aid so it is very important that everyone could learn it quickly and correctly and use it at the right time to save people.<br>
        The last goal is to make a forum for the patients in each category so that they can communicate with each other and exchange valuable information. Besides that, they will have someone to be sympathetic to and feel less lonely. The patient's emotion is very important during the treatment so this forum can help them to relax and gain a better result. This may take a long time for “Health Care” to develop as we planned but hopefully, it is not impossible so we can have some contribution to our society.<br>
        If things do not go as planned, we must completely examine our plan as well as the previously created development strategy in order to identify the areas that are not developing smoothly. We can discover the core reasons for any setbacks or deviations from the planned course of action by performing a thorough investigation. This introspective approach provides us with vital insights into possible problems, allowing us to make educated judgments and make the required changes to realign our project toward success.<br>
        The most important part of the project is our first goal so if we have to prioritise it is definitely goal number one. Because other goals are based on the first goal so if we can not develop our project like we wanted for any reason, out of time, or lack of resources, the only goal we keep is the first one.
    </p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">b.Plan and Progress</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">Our main inspiration comes from the world after COVID-19 pandemic and the downturn of the economy with the adoption of digital technology trends. Since that, the healthcare environment has radically changed and developed. In addition, with a wide range of advancements in the field of medical services and new technologies, healthcare app trends have made practitioners' and patients' lives more bearable. In Vietnam, health-care applications are not widely known and used, especially by teenagers, since they are one of the groups with the heaviest mobile phone app uses (Pew Research Center, 2015). Furthermore, there is only one Vietnam-made healthcare app which is called S-Health to provide free health care information and services to the elderly. Which means that the government in the medical areas was already aware of the digital-healthcare trend and took the initial move, but however seems to be inefficient since this app did not make a great mark on the environment and appears to be forgotten quickly. Based on this first step, we strongly believe that we can continue the mission and hope to establish a worthy healthcare mobile apps trend in Vietnam, despite the fact that we recognize that it will be challenging due to our lack of experiences, this idea of using technology to improve the medical services for patients motivates us to begin and work on this project.<br>
        The first approach is to define our goal and the sources and providers for our project, then we came up with the purpose of assisting physicians, healthy diet and improving the sleep behaviours for users. As we all know, eating and sleeping habits are crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, physical fitness and furthermore is to reduce stress in today's hectic world. Additionally, we want to spread the information of the link between diet and sleep, as your diet and nutrition may affect the quality of your sleep, and some foods and beverages may make it more or less difficult for you to obtain the rest you need. Otherwise, getting enough sleep is also linked to maintaining a healthy body weight, which is advantageous for those wanting to reduce weight. Based on this data, we decided to concentrate on the three key areas of nutrition and meal planning, exercise, and sleep tracking to assist users in keeping track of their health and nutrition levels, which is also a smarter strategy to prevent diseases more effectively than functional supplements.<br>
        After that, we move on to determine our main target audiences and demographic segments, then come up with the target marketing strategies. After the decision, teenagers and middle ages are the targeted groups, since adolescence is an important period for childrens growth, in terms of both physical and mental development. According to the professionals, teenagers need more nutrition than adults do, therefore they need to eat well. Otherwise, what they eat as teenagers can also have an effect on their health as adults. The same for their sleep behaviours, teenagers need to sleep since it is crucial for their physical and mental growth. Most teenagers are recommended to sleep 8 to 10 hours per night. Sadly, evidence shows that many teenagers receive much less sleep than they require which may affect their academic performance, emotional health and eating behaviours, vice-versa. And then in the mediaeval ages, people suffered from exhaustion and inadequate nutrition due to working longer than 8 hours every day, sometimes even overtime. As a result, we wish to concentrate on using our tools for tracking healthy eating, exercise, and sleep to assist these key audiences in maintaining and improving their healthy lifestyles.<br>
        The next step is to check out the market and furthermore our competitors in order to provide a better and unique user experience. Since the app store has hundreds, if not thousands, of this kind of healthcare apps, however, in our point of views, depending on who, why, and how the app is used, as well as other variables like the features, technological stack, and more, the design of a health app may be radically different from the others. Additionally, the Vietnamese market has not yet recognized healthcare applications, so this is our time to break through, also further with the help of multilingual subtitles. We also aimed to surpass our rivals by providing wealthy information, interesting content, and distinctive features, with stunning graphics and a style to set it apart from other apps of a similar nature.<br>
        Moreover, to create our application perfectly, we then concentrate on developing more advanced features. The first is user health reports, which can give patients a better understanding of their physical status by asking them a survey after logging in, allowing us to offer the most appropriate course and technique. Information about regimen, weight, caloric intake, pulse, heart rate, and other private data is collected in order to share with their fitness coaches or companions to receive the better guidance and support.The next one is the real-time video call and voice chat connection for users who don't have the time to see their instructors in person might benefit from this function by connecting with them online through chats and video conversations, especially in the fitness section. We also offer dashboards, a consolidated database of important data that enables customers access health news and data, along with a virtual assistant like chatbot who is available around-the-clock to help them anytime they need it. In addition, we consist of a users portal, which provides the users to get alerts, reminders and messengers from the application so that they will not miss out the courses or new notifications and updates. Last but not least is the global access which allows the users mobile devices or personal computers to access this app anytime, anyplace. These are only a few of the most important features; we are still working on these areas and anticipate releasing more updates in the near future.<br>
        We are aware that this project still has certain errors and issues because we have only completed the basic components of it and may release it as a trial. Since user information is so private and sensitive, data security should be one of our top priorities. Users' data must always be safeguarded. However, we just finished creating and designing the app and web browser, therefore we haven't yet started working on the security software. So that, to make sure that the users of our program feel secure and at ease, if I had to delegate this project to another team, I would appreciate it if they could assist us in completing this final stage.
    </p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">c.Roles</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">For this project, a specific role of the game was defined to ensure effective collaboration and assignment of tasks. Roles include Minh Anh as Technical Designer, Thong as Development Team Leader, Minh as Information Retrieval and Support Member, and Phuc as User Interface Designer.<br>
        Minh Anh has been assigned the role of Technical Designer specialising in very robust system architecture, database design and master engineering planning. Minh Anh's responsibility is to analyse project requirements, design the technical structure of the application, and ensure the integration of different components and technologies.<br>
        Thong in the role of Development Team Leader, assume responsibility for running the development team, overseeing program setting activities and certainly overseeing standards and implementing best program setting. Because of his expertise, he will guide and support team members, solve technical formulas and manage the overall progress of the development process.<br>
        Minh's role as an Information Support and Retrieval member includes gathering and organising unexpected, relevant information such as medical data or research papers, necessary for the project. Minh provides support to the Technical Designer and development team by ensuring the availability of necessary resources and assisting in data retrieval and processing.<br>
        Phuc took on the role of User Interface Designer, leveraging his design skills based on the expertise available from Java to create attractive and easy-to-use interfaces. Phuc's role is important in ensuring the application's user interface meets the needs and expectations of the target users, enhancing the overall user experience.<br>
        These roles have been defined to allocate responsibilities based on the strengths and expertise of the team members. By assigning each person a specific role, the project can benefit from focused efforts, effective assignment of tasks, and making the most of individual skills. It should be noted, however, that flexibility in game roles and adaptation based on project needs also offers important value.<br>
    </p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">d.Scope and Limits</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">The purpose of our research is to provide a platform that connects the healthcare experts to the users to give advice and guidance to help improve their lifestyles. The app will focus mainly on assisting the users to handle a number of treatable health issues that they currently have as well as giving them an easier way to communicate with experts and other users to exchange information and learn more about the current state of healthcare and wellbeing.<BR>
        Our project will not support severe health conditions that require extensive care and attention from a professional medical facility. We are aware that the app is not capable of fully examining the users as well as taking in depth measurements of their current condition. The app will not automatically recommend medications for the users but it will lay out the information regarding their conditions as well as provide a way for them to contact the experts to ask about it.<BR>
    </p>

    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">e.Tools and Technologies</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">The project we are developing requires the following software and tools:<br>
        Python (Version 3.7 or above): Python is a versatile, widely-used programming language that is commonly used in various applications, including healthcare. Its rich library and framework ecosystem make it suitable for data analysis, machine learning, and efficient storage of large amounts of information and data. Some team members have prior experience with Python, including data processing and analysis using libraries such as NumPy and pandas.<br>
        Java Development Kit (JDK) (Version 8 or above): Java is a popular programming language known for its scalability and platform independence. It is commonly used in enterprise application development, including healthcare systems. In our project, Java will be applied to develop the user interface due to its accessibility and ease of use. Some team members have experience with Java, including object-oriented programming, database connectivity, and web application development using frameworks like Spring.<br>
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE): IDEs typically support software development and include features such as code editing, debugging, and version management. Popular examples for Python include PyCharm, Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebook. For Java, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans are widely used. After research, we will decide which IDE to use in this project based on its richness and adaptability. Some team members have experience using PyCharm and Eclipse for Python and Java development, respectively.<br>
        Database Management System (DBMS): A DBMS is necessary to efficiently store and manage healthcare-related data. The DBMS will be integrated with Python to ensure maximum efficiency in storing secure information. In this case, we will use MySQL. As some team members have experience working with MySQL, including database creation, schema design, and executing queries.<br>
        Regarding software licences, it is important to comply with the licence terms of the specific tools and libraries being used. Open-source licences such as MIT, Apache, and GNU GPL are commonly used in the Python and Java ecosystems. Team members are familiar with open-source licensing and will ensure compliance with the relevant licence.<br>
        In terms of hardware, besides a laptop or similar device, additional hardware may be beneficial if the healthcare application involves advanced features such as machine learning algorithms, where high-performance CPU or GPU resources could be useful. Hardware requirements can be assessed based on specific project functionalities and scale.<br>
        Overall, team members have prior experience with the mentioned tools and technologies, allowing them to effectively utilise Python and Java for healthcare application development.<br>
    </p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">f.Testing</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text"> &nbsp In order to test the medical application whether the development of the application is effective, we will adopt a systematic and iterative testing methodology throughout the life of the project. Instead of testing as a final project, early collaborative testing is critical to verify the direction of the project and ensure it matches user requirements.<br>
        In the initial phase, we will create a snapshot and transient of the application to verify feasibility and gather feedback. Testing these restrictions will help identify any potential problems or mismatches between the project and the desired product. It allows for early modification and ensures the development is consistent with the original item title.<br>
        User testing will play an important role in assessing the usability of the app and gathering feedback from target users. Test users will be searched through various methods, such as reaching out to medical professionals, interacting with potential users, or holding a usability testing session with people representing them. the user uses the target item of application. The number of test users required to be able to change options according to project regulations and requirements. However, the offer to participate is sample-sized with at least 10-15 users to gather comprehensive feedback and ensure a representative user experience.<br>
        In addition, the selection of test users may require some basic criteria based on the context of the application. This may include people with medical experience, expertise in a particular medical area, or people with specific characteristics of use. Targets include users who can provide valuable information about the application's functionality, applicability, and relevance to their needs.<br>
          Our goals from this feedback work are:<br>
              -Feedback from test users indicates satisfaction with the app's usability, functionality, and performance.<br>
              -Identify and resolve any critical issues or errors found during testing.<br>
              -Verify that the application responds to the specified requirements and is consistent with the project objectives.<br>
              -Confirm that the application works as intended and provides the expected results.<br>
              -Improves resiliency based on feedback received, ensuring continuous improvement of the application.<br>
        So, by applying iterative testing and evaluating user feedback, the medical application can be tailored, validated and ultimately considered successful in meeting the needs and requirements. target user expectations.<br>

      </div>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">h.Risks</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">Developing an app can be challenging at times and requires the team to plan ahead the risks we need to take as well as the preparation we need to minimise the risks to keep the project running. As the cost of producing an app can be very expensive, we must do everything we can to ensure that the app will be appealing to the audience and attract as many users as possible.<br>
        As a health app, our jobs require us to make an impact on other people lifestyles. This means the information we provided must be carefully studied and analysed by certified experts. A piece of information that has not been carefully tested might result in serious harm to the users health. This issue is greater when the health advice they are getting come from an app on their mobile device, which has very limited ways to actually evaluate a persons health condition. Our team understands the limit of what a health app can or cannot do, which is why the app will not try to address serious health issues (such as cancer or heart disease) as those conditions will require special attention from professional institutions. Instead, we focus heavily on giving lifestyle advice and instructions to guide the users to improve their daily lifestyles using carefully examined information that is approved by professional healthcare experts. These activities might seem insignificant, such as making an exercise session and meal planning for the users, but they will benefit the user greatly in the long term and minimise the health risk of the app significantly. Furthermore, we can push its effectiveness by customising the users personal experience based on the current state of their health to give them the best suitable advice. One of our most important priorities is that we will constantly check the quality of the information the app is giving with the help of professionals as well as providing a way for the user to be able to connect to a healthcare expert themselves to learn more about how to improve their lives.<br>
        Another risk that might appear would be the risk to the security and user data protection. As an app that requires some personal information from the users, there is a chance that hackers will try to hack into our server to get their hands on said valuable information, such as the users health condition or credit card information. Therefore, it is necessary to have a dedicated team of experts in cyber security that protect our app from cyber attacks and make sure that our server runs properly at all times. We will also be very clear when asking the users for their information, letting them know exactly what information we need and where that information will go.<br>
        We also anticipated that developing the app will encounter technical difficulties that come from the programs and software we use to build the app. Softwares such as Python, Java, and React Native are crucial when developing an app, but each of them comes with a number of problems that need to be handled correctly or they might cause major damage to the project. As a small group, we do not have the resources to handle all the technical issues, therefore we will look for development partners, such as Native developers that specialise in React Native, to help handle a part of the load. While having specialists to help us with some important parts is a great way to allow us to focus more on our goal, it also carries a risk. If we partner up with the wrong people, they will cause even more issues for us to deal with, which will significantly increase our workload as well as our budget. In order to avoid this tragedy, we will check the reliability of the group we planned to partner with carefully before reaching out to them. We will also consider paying them hefty for their support to gain their loyalty in the long term.<br>
    </p>
    <h4 style= "font-size:medium">i.Group processes and communications</h4>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">When it comes to a group project, communication is the key to success. In order to avoid communication breakdown within the team, we strive to create a healthy relationship with each other and stable communication between each member. We created a group chat to make communication more accessible and plan online meetings about two to three times through messenger calls to discuss the assignment. Furthermore, we also agreed to meet face-to-face at least once a week after the class tutorial to not only talk about the assignment but also about how we are doing in life. We all understand that if one member has some difficulties that might affect their performance in class, the whole teams performance is also affected. Therefore we try to help each other to take care of ourselves so that no one will feel lost.<br>
      In order to keep track of the project, a timetable is created in Excel and shared with everyone so they can update their process as well as check on how the others are doing. We plan ahead by checking everyone's future schedule and pace our work appropriately to avoid being cramped with deadlines. This timetable is updated frequently which makes it easier for each team member to catch up on the work if they are busy for a period of time and cannot attend classes or meetings. Every Saturday, we hold a meeting to inform everyone of the progress of the assignment as well as check on everyone to see if they have any trouble with their part so the group can work together to resolve it. In our group, we always try to make sure that everyone is still following the lesson and we encourage one another to let everyone know if theres a problem. In the case where a member is busy for an extended period of time, they will notify the team at least a week prior to that event and we will adjust the timetable to adapt to the current situation. We always record our online meetings just in case a teammate does not respond to text messages or meeting calls, they can view the recording in their own time.<br>

    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">As I once stated, our team has not yet found a solution to the issue of user data security so if we have the option to hire more team members to help us improve and finish our project, the security expert position should be given top priority. To secure the security of user personal information and our program itself, a security expert's participation is essential; they are in charge of spotting any vulnerabilities and creating the necessary security solutions to any risks. Furthermore, establishing encryption, authentication, and authorisation procedures, as well as designing new security measures. To be specific, we have certain requirements for this role, such as having a wealth of mobile app platform knowledge like iOS, Android since we will focus on these two. Also the understanding of security issues which affect mobile apps, such as unreliable data storage, poor authentication, unsecured communication, etc. To ensure data protection, the security professional should be well-versed in encryption protocols, methodologies, and best practices, and also be familiar with OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) recommendations, which provide a thorough list of security concerns faced by mobile apps.<BR>
        The next position is data analyst, the one to find patterns and trends, evaluate the app's huge volumes of data and also gain understanding of users behaviour and experiences to improve the users care. To pinpoint functional gaps in the app, data analysts should collaborate closely with the development team to analyse data and find bugs in the app's code and other problems that may affect the app performance. The data analyst is someone who should have a basic understanding of healthcare data and how it is collected, stored, and analysed, furthermore the statistical analytic approaches like regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modelling. To handle and analyse data, they need to be familiar with computer languages like Python, R, or SQL. Communication skill is also needed since they must be able to clearly and succinctly convey their results to stakeholders who are not technical.<br>
        The third one is a designer, who can design the app and provide a user experience that is both attractive and easy to use. An effective designer will be able to produce a visually beautiful and engaging design that complements the functionality of the app and be guaranteed that the design is suitable with mobile devices and offers a flawless user experience. Similar to data analysts, communication skills are required to make sure they communicate clearly with the development team, stakeholders, and end users.<br> 
        Last but not least is the marketing specialist who is responsible for creating and implementing marketing strategies to advertise the app and encourage user uptake. And as the marketing expert, understanding of medical language and regulatory requirements is needed. Excellent digital marketing abilities are also a must, including those in content marketing, social media marketing, email marketing, and search engine optimization. Next is the data analysis abilities to evaluate the data and choose the best marketing plans and execute them successfully.<br>

        <h1 style= "font-size: medium">Phuc</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">During this assignment, I have gone through a lot of difficulties. The first one is the due date of this assignment, and other assignments and tests are pretty close to each other. Even though I have many troubles, however, I still try my best to finish my task on time because I know that one person being late can cause serious consequences. I think some of my parts in the assignment are not as good as I expected, so I think I have to improve my searching and writing skills so I can use my skills faster and sharper. There is one thing that I am surprised about myself that I can stay up very late to finish my task without being tired, I usually do not stay up late but this is quite new to me, perhaps because it is nearly the time assigned so I concentrate on finishing rather than feeling tired. One thing I learned from this group is that communication is very important in group projects, I think that I lack communication and need to have more interaction to push up the speed of the progress and ensure the quality of the project can reach our desired.</p>

        <h1 style= "font-size: medium">Minh Anh</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">Since I didn't know much about IT at the beginning, I'll be honest and say that I didn't anticipate it to be this challenging and difficult. I had a lot of issues with assignments 2 and 3 and occasionally thought that I couldn't possibly complete this task. Although we all suffered a lot, my team and I are glad to state that we have never argued and that we always work hard to give our project our best effort. In addition to the class meetings, we typically spend time calling to ensure that the draft and work are completed on time. Additionally, with the help of our lecturer's recommendations and our classmates' criticism, we quickly completed our project. Yes, it still has a lot of flaws and errors, but I'm really satisfied with it because it gave me the opportunity to advance my knowledge of a new field—IT—as well as my teamwork and communication abilities. And I sincerely hope that after this lesson and task, everyone in my group will feel motivated and happy.</p>

        <h1 style= "font-size: medium">Minh Thong</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">When we near the end of the assignment phase, after a joint reevaluation, we believe we have done a good job together. Our communication and collaboration were very good throughout the project, as shown by the regular project meeting recordings. These logs record discussions, assign tasks, and update progress all well. One strength is that our sharing of roles and responsibilities has been effective. Each team member has clear mandates based on trust, ensuring efficient assignment of tasks and making the most of individual skills. So we created a workflow that allows us to work together with the goal of getting the best out of the project. However, there are some aspects that need to be improved. One aspect of that is our time management. While we met the constraints, we realized we were able to allocate time reasonably and set clear timelines for the different phases of the project. This will bring better efficiency and improve our project quality. During this assignment, we learned the importance of effective communication and active listening within the team. We recognize that agility and flexibility are critical to successful collaboration. In addition, adapting ideas and tasks is essential, and regular feedback evaluation helps identify areas for improvement. We realize that by leveraging our individual strengths and supporting each other's growth, we can achieve good results. Even so, our team did a good job of communicating, collaborating, and dividing roles. Going forward, we will try to improve time management and define clear timelines. The utmost effort in the team and the lessons of effective communication and flexibility will definitely benefit us in the future.</p>

        <h1 style= "font-size: medium">Minh Ngo</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">When I first met my teammates, I was surprised to know that each member comes from a different major. It is fascinating to get a team of people who pursue different majors as we will have different perspectives when working together. I believe that we were able to set up a strong connection between everyone and maintain a stable communication system throughout the project. Everyone was supportive of one another, reaching out and offering help to the other teammates when they encountered difficulties. Nonetheless, there were times when one of us had an emergency and was not able to respond to the team for a period of time, which gave the team a hard time adjusting the schedule. In my opinion, one of the ways we can reduce the impact of an event when a teammate has some emergency issues is to work on the project sooner. By pushing the progress at least two weeks before the deadline, we will have more time to be flexible and can make changes to the schedule easier when a problem arises. After working together as a team for quite a long time, I have learned that to have a great team, everyone needs to respect each other and prioritize helping the group instead of worrying about their workload.</p>

    <h2 style= "color: rgb(2, 25, 117); font-size: larger;">b.Group Reflection</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';" class="smaller-text">To sum up, we have a great time working together on this project. Our different backgrounds really help us to get a wider view of the tasks as well as find creative ways to tackle a problem. Furthermore, our different strengths allow us to cover each other’s weaknesses, which improves the efficiency of the project drastically. Some of us are very good at programming and some of us are amazing at gathering and summarising information. During the process, we were able to communicate with each other very well and have high respect for different opinions. Our team was able to meet with each other quite regularly via both online and face–to–face meetings to discuss the project and check on the others’ progress. The workload was distributed evenly and appropriately based on each member’s strengths and weaknesses. There were some delays during the process, but everyone was willing to put extra effort into the assignment which helps the team meet the deadlines on time consistently. Nonetheless, we recognized that there are some aspects that need improvement. One of the challenges we encountered was time management. Even though we usually finish our project on time, everyone seems to have to stay up really late in the last few days to finalise their work, which is unhealthy in the long run. We have created a timetable to divide the work into many phases and set up multiple due dates throughout the project. However, sometimes a teammate has an emergency issue that delays their progress drastically, causing them to either not be able to finish the task on time or have to work excessively in a shorter amount of time to get it done. In future assignments, we will focus heavily on time management to make sure that the work is done and finalised in a reasonable amount of time without having anyone stay up very late at night. We would also try to plan ahead and notify the team about personal problems earlier so that the team can support each other during those harsh times to help reduce the stress of that individual. This project has helped us to understand the importance of communication and collaboration in a team, as well as time management, which will be vital for us in our future careers.
